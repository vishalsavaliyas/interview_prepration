    <h2>What is React?</h2>
    <p>
      React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was
      developed by Facebook and is widely used for creating single-page
      applications and mobile applications. React allows developers to create
      reusable UI components, manage the state of their applications, and
      efficiently update the DOM (Document Object Model) when the state changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      React is a JavaScript library used to build:<br />

      Web apps<br />

      UI components (button, navbar, cards)<br />

      Single Page Applications (SPA)<br /><br />
      Why React is so popular?<br />

      ✅ Fast<br />
      ✅ Easy to use<br />
      ✅ Component-based<br />
      ✅ Huge community<br />
      <br />
      React is for:<br />

      ✔ Frontend<br />
      ✔ UI<br />
      ✔ Making screens<br /><br />
      React is not a framework. It is a library that focuses on building UI. It
      can be used with other libraries or frameworks like Redux, React Router,
      etc.
    </p>

    <h2>Setting Up a React Application</h2>
    <p>To set up a React application, you can follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your development
        environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a new directory for your React application and navigate to it in
        your terminal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the following command in your terminal or in vs code terminal to
        create a new React app:
        <br />
        <code>npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Navigate to the newly created directory and run the following command to
        install the dependencies:
        <br />
        <code>npm install</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        Run the following command to start the development server:
        <br />
        <code>npm run dev</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        to exit the development server, press <code>Ctrl + C</code> in the
        terminal
      </li>
      <li>
        Open your web browser and go to
        <code>http://localhost:5173</code> to view your React application.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can now start building your React application by editing the files
        in the <code>src</code> directory.
      </li>
      <li>Open: src/App.jsx</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This will start a local development server, and you can view your React
      application in your web browser at <code>http://localhost:5173</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and
      setting up a React application is a simple process. By following these
      steps, you can create a basic React application and start building your
      user interface.

    <h1>what is vite vs CRA (Create React App)</h1>
    <p>
      Vite and Create React App (CRA) are both tools used to set up and develop
      React applications, but they have some key differences in terms of their
      architecture, performance, and features.
    </p>
    <h2>Vite</h2>
    <p>
      Vite is a modern build tool that leverages native ES modules in the
      browser for faster development and build times. It uses a dev server that
      serves files over native ES modules, allowing for instant module loading
      and hot module replacement (HMR) without the need for bundling during
      development. Vite also supports features like TypeScript, JSX, and CSS
      modules out of the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vite is a modern frontend development build tool created by Evan You
      (creator of Vue.js). It is designed to be faster, lightweight, and more
      efficient than older tools.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Where is Vite used?<br /><br />

      For creating modern JavaScript web applications<br />

      For frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, SolidJS, Vanilla JS<br />

      Ideal for projects needing fast startup, hot reload, and optimized
      builds<br />
      <br />
      Why developers use Vite?<br /><br />
      Extremely fast dev server<br />

      Uses native ES modules in the browser<br />

      Lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)<br />

      Optimized production builds using Rollup<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Create React App (CRA)</h2>
    <p>
      Create React App is a popular tool for setting up React applications that
      provides a pre-configured build setup using Webpack and Babel. CRA
      abstracts away the configuration details, allowing developers to focus on
      writing code without worrying about the underlying build process. CRA
      includes features like hot module replacement, code splitting, and
      optimized production builds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create React App (CRA) is an older tool created by Facebook to quickly set
      up a React project without manual configuration.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Differences</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Performance: Vite is generally faster than CRA during development due to
        its use of native ES modules and on-demand module loading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Configuration: CRA abstracts away configuration details, while Vite
        allows for more customization and flexibility in the build process.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ecosystem: CRA has a larger ecosystem and community support, while Vite
        is relatively newer but gaining popularity quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Features: Vite provides features like hot module replacement, CSS
        modules, and TypeScript support, while CRA has features like code
        splitting and optimized production builds.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Both Vite and Create React App are excellent tools for setting up and
      developing React applications. The choice between the two ultimately
      depends on your specific needs and preferences as a developer. If you
      prioritize speed and flexibility, Vite may be the better choice. If you
      prefer a more opinionated setup with a larger ecosystem, CRA may be the
      way to go.

    <h1>what is JSX?</h1>
    <p>
      JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you
      to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. It is commonly used
      in React applications to define the structure and appearance of user
      interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      JSX allows you to write code that looks similar to HTML, but it is
      actually JavaScript. This makes it easier to create and manage complex
      user interfaces by allowing you to define the structure and behavior of
      your components in a single file.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features of JSX</h2>
    <ul>

    <h1>what is react compiler</h1>
    <p>
      A React compiler is a tool that transforms JSX (JavaScript XML) code into
      standard JavaScript code that can be executed by web browsers. JSX is a
      syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like
      code within their JavaScript code, making it easier to create and manage
      complex user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The React compiler takes the JSX code and converts it into standard
      JavaScript code that can be understood by web browsers. This process is
      necessary because web browsers do not natively understand JSX syntax.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features of React Compiler</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transforms JSX code into standard JavaScript code that can be executed
        by web browsers.

    <h1>what is react router</h1>
    <p>
      React Router is a popular library for building single-page applications
      with React. It provides a way to manage navigation and routing within a
      React application, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive
      user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      React Router allows developers to define routes for different pages or
      components within the application. When a user navigates to a specific
      route, React Router will render the corresponding component and update the
      URL in the browser's address bar.
    </p>
    <h2>Key Features of React Router</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provides a way to manage navigation and routing within a React
        application.
